# Random-Password-Generator

## Description

This website was created to help people who wish to create a random password but struggle to do so. After answering multiple prompts, the website will then take the types of characters selected into account and create a random password. Some of the criterias are selecting if they wish to use lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This website contains notes on HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

## Usage

The website has one main section. However, upon clicking on the button, the user will be asked a series of questions in the form of alert boxes. The first question asks how long the user wishes their password to be. Upon submitting a number less than 8 or more than 128, the user will get an error message. When the user does submit a number between 8 and 128, they will be asked which types of characters they wish to include: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The website will then use this information to create the user a random password! The user could select one, two, three, or even all four of the characters to include in their password. If none of the types of characters are selected, then the user will get an error message asking for at least one type of character to be selected.
